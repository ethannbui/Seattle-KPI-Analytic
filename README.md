# Seattle KPI project

**Problem:** Explore the Seattle lodging market using CoStar KPI data from 2018 to 2025. The goal is to organize, clean, and analyze key hotel performance metrics—such as Occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR—to understand how the market changed over time, including trends, seasonality, and major shifts across the period. Findings and insights derived from the analysis will be documented in this project as the work progresses.

**Insight:**
- Gap between supply and demand remains, with supply outpacing demand recovery​

- Seattle lodging market shows steady post-pandemic recovery with ADR and RevPAR surpassing pre-2020 levels.​

- Luxury and Upper Upscale hotels had highest contribution in ADR.​

- Submarket Seattle CBD and Bellevue the strongest submarkets.

- The 2025 market is quite stable, occupancy hovering around 70%

**Delivery:**
- Occupancy upside may be capped short-term unless demand accelerates or supply growth slows—competition for guests remains high.

- Since ADR/RevPAR are above pre-2020, the market’s recovery is quite fast, meaning operators are protecting revenue even if occupancy is not fully back.

- High-end segments are leading performance, so strategies tied to premium demand (corporate, events, affluent leisure) matter most for rate strength.

- Investment and expansion opportunities are strongest in Seattle CBD and Bellevue, where performance momentum is concentrated.

- With 2025 stability, planning can shift from “recovery mode” to optimization (revenue management, segmentation, and cost control) rather than pure demand rebuilding.
